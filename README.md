   The name of our project is called “Automa Parking” which translates to simply an automatic parking system. However, since this kind of system is very common we decided to make that idea into a more renewed, refreshed and upgraded system. This is why we called the name Automa instead of Automatic as we wanted the user to have a futuristic feeling when saying the name.
