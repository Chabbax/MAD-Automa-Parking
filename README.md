### Description

Despite the fact that you writing a technical document, it needs to be clear. Describing your project makes it easier for people to contribute to it and alos use it!

In this project you wil find the following readMes:

 - [Android Project ReadMe template](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/android)
 - [Web project template](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/website)
 - A General contibutions guide in each project

### How to use them

1. All the files are in markdown format. While it is good to learn markdown. It is always great to have the [Markdown CheatSheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) bookmarked somewhere in your browser.
If you can learn it, awesome! It will save you time...But it really is not important: **the more you use markdown, the better you get at it O.o**.

2. There are different Markdown templates for each type of project as below: 
    * [Android](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/android)- For android focused ReadMe
    * [Website](https://github.com/tamzi/ReadMe-MasterTemplates/tree/master/website)- For websites with HTML, CSS and JS
    * IOS ...coming soon - FOr IOS projects
    * Scripts ....coming soon - For Python, JS type projects
    * brief ...coming soon - TLo edit, this is a minimal version

3. Copy the respective files depending on the type of project. Paste it and edit the file.

4. As a general rule, provide link to download the app if its published on the playstore /website if it is hosted at the description section above.See image below
